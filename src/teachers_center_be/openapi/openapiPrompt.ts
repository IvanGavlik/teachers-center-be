     Next tasks on vocabulary.
     Make me n tasks and each of them should have 5 subtasks. if n is zero do not create tasks on vocabulary and ignore instruction about tasks. n in this case is ` + this.vocabularyQuestions + `
     Here are instruction for first 3 vocabulary tasks (other tasks generate on your own). Example: If n is 5 for first three task follow instructions rest generate own you own.
     Here are Instructions about vocabulary tasks consider this only if n is not zero.
        1. The task should be circled whether the statement is true or false, the statements are based on the text.
        After that, select potentially new words for the students and create examples in which you show the students how these words are used in the ` + this.language + `,
         i.e. based on your explanation, the students should conclude what that word means in native language, without you having said the word in native language.
        After that comes the 2nd task.
       The 2nd task should include simple word recognition.
       The 3rd task, the students themselves must determine which word corresponds,
        it should be more complex than the 2nd task and the 4th task should require the students to produce something on that topic.

    Here are instructions about grammar tasks

      diverse, so each task should be assigned to a different type. One task should include work in pairs or in groups.
      Decide that yourself and generate such a task.  The class is intended for students at ` + this.languageLevel + ` level.

Teaching Approach:

    Contextual Learning: Use images or scenarios to illustrate each phrase. For example, show a ticket or a hotel room to make it more relatable.

    Role Play: Set up a role-play situation where students can practice using these phrases in a conversational context, such as at a train station or a restaurant.

    Listening Practice: Play audio clips of native speakers using these phrases in context. This will help with pronunciation and listening skills.

    Flashcards: Create flashcards with the German phrase on one side and the English translation on the other, allowing for fun memorization activities.

    Group Work: Have students work in pairs or small groups to create a short dialogue using these phrases. This encourages speaking practice and collaboratio
